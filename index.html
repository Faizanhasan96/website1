    <div class="content1">
        <p class="p">At GTurbo™, we specialise in Diesel engine optimisation. Our philosophy is to provide <br>you
            with a turbocharger or overall package that is a specifically engineered performance <br>solution
            tailored for your unique needs. Let us work with you and take your experience <br> to the next level by
            delivering exceptional engine performance.Turbos are composed <br>of a shaft with a turbine wheel on one
            end and a compressor wheel on the other.<br> <br>These are covered by a snail-shaped housing featuring
            an inlet port,
            which the wasted<br> exhaust gases enter at a high pressure. As the air passes through the turbine,
            the turbine spins <br>and the compressor turns with it, drawing in vast quantities of air which are
            compressed and <br>passed out of the outlet port.<br><br>
